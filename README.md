## Context
You received the content of the variable data `./src/data.ts` from API.
It's a collection of contractors, the countries they work with and if they can work remotely.

## TODO
We want to extract a sorted list of all countries for which the contractor remote attribute is true.
Add new endpoint to expose that list
